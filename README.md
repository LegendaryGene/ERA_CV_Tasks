![Learning 101](https://github.com/ERA-IITK/learning101/blob/master/learning101.png)

# Getting Started

### OpenCV
Download and set up OpenCV on **Linux**. Preferably **version 4.2** for compatibility with ROS Noetic.

### Maths Basics
- What are convolutions? How can it be used to segregate or mix different signals?
- Write a snippet to convolve an $N \times M$ matrix with a $K \times L$ kernel.

### Image Processing 101
- Learn about basic thresholding operations, resizing, image erosion, dilation, filters, masking, gaussian thresholding, and image transformations.
- What are the features in an image? Read about and experiment with various feature detection methods.

# Task 1
- Design filters to classify the following symbols -

  <img src="https://github.com/ERA-IITK/learning_Y21/blob/main/images/image5.png" width="150" />
</p>

- Write a code to detect these symbols in the image given below -

</p>

### Object Detection 101
Learn about hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and contours, and write a snippet to determine RGB boundaries for an object present in the region of interest.
- Use classic detection techniques to detect a colored object in the live video feed.
- Learn about harr cascading method and implement human face detection.

# Into Neural Networks
Write a code that takes numbers from $0$ to $9$ and arithmetic symbols like $-, +, \times, \div$ as input and perform basic calculations. <br>
<ins>Input Format</ins>: An image of the expression which is to be evaluated.
